description: Teleport enterprise license file configuration parameters and requirements
---

Commercial Teleport subscriptions require a valid license. The license file can
be downloaded from the [Teleport Customer
Portal](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login).

The Teleport license file contains an X.509 certificate and the corresponding
private key in PEM format. Place the downloaded file on your Teleport Auth
Servers and set the `license_file` configuration parameter of your
`teleport.yaml` to point to the file location:

```yaml
auth_service:
    license_file: /var/lib/teleport/license.pem
```

The `license_file` path can be either absolute or relative to the configured
`data_dir`. If the license file path is not set, Teleport will look for the
`license.pem` file in the configured `data_dir`.

  Only Auth Servers require the license. Proxies and Nodes that do not also have Auth role enabled do not need the license.
