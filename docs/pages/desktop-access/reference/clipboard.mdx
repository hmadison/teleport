description: Using Clipboard Sharing with Teleport Desktop Access.
---

Teleport Desktop Access supports copying and pasting text between your browser
and a remote Windows Desktop.

<Adminition type="note">
This feature requires a Chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome, Brave,
or Microsoft Edge.
</Admonition>

Clipboard sharing is configured via Teleport's RBAC system. It is enabled by default,
but can be disabled by setting the following role option on one or more of a user's
roles:

```yaml
desktop_clipboard: false
```

If a clipboard sharing is enabled for a user, the browser will prompt for access
to the system clipboard when a desktop session is started. Grant this access to
proceed.

{
    /* screenshot of prompt */
}

- what if unsupported browser
- what if user clicks no

When a desktop session is active, Teleport will indicate whether clipboard sharing
is enabled in the menu bar at the top of the screen.

{
    /* screenshots for enabled / disabled */
}
